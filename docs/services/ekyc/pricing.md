## Pay Per Use Fees

#### OCR + Face Recognition + LivenessÂ Detection

| Usage                 | Fees per Transaction ( USD ) | Fees per Transaction ( MYR ) |
| :-------------------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| 1 - 100               | 0.73                         | 3.50                         |
| 101 - 300             | 0.63                         | 3.00                         |
| 301 - 500             | 0.54                         | 2.60                         |
| 501 - 1000            | 0.38                         | 1.80                         |
| > 1,000               | 0.31                         | 1.50                         |

### Calculation example

The table above represents the usage fees for the service. The amount will be charged based on after the first range is utilized. For example, if you have utilized a total amount of 1,000 calls, the first 100 calls will be 3.50 of charge per transaction and any subsequent calls will be charged as 3.00 and so on. Another clearer example can be found below.

Note: In cases where only the OCR process is successfully completed but facial recognition fails, the full service fee will still apply. This charge reflects the computational resources already utilized, including CPU and GPU processing, which are necessary to execute the OCR functions. Despite the partial outcome, these resources incur costs that contribute to the overall service fee.

**Total Calls made = 1,000**

| Range                 | Fees per Transaction ( MYR ) | Cost Breakdown ( MYR )      |

| 1 - 100               | 3.50                         | 100 x 3.50 = 350            |
| 101 - 300             | 3.00                         | 200 x 3.00 = 600            |
| 301 - 500             | 2.60                         | 200 x 2.60 = 520            |
| 501 - 1000            | 1.80                         | 500 x 1.80 = 900            |
| > 1,000               | 1.50                         | 0                           |
