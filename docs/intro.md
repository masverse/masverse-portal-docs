Welcome to the first step of diving into the world of blockchain. Here are a few steps to help you get started. <br/>

MasChain are building web3 infrastructure, that aims to lower the barrier for companies to onboard blockchain and web3.
We are building this RESTful API based Service Layer, as the integrations points between MasChain and companies. While abstracting out the complicated web3 concepts and languages.

We also separate different use cases into different Service.
