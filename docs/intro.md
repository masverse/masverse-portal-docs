# Introduction

Welcome to the first step of diving into the world of blockchain. Here are a few steps to help you get started. <br/>

MasChain are building web3 infrastructure, that aims to lower the barrier for companies to onboard blockchain and web3.
We are building this RESTful API based Service Layer, as the integrations points between MasChain and companies. While abstracting out the complicated web3 concepts and languages.

We also separate different use cases into different Service.


## Getting Started

To kickstart integrations, you will need to go to [portal.maschain.com*](https://portal.maschain.com/) to register for an enterprise account. Once you have completed the KYB process you may choose to subscribe a **Service** that you're interested to integrate and create an API key

 What you'll need
- **API Key**
- **API Secret Key**

## Generate a new key

1. Sign in and head over to the API key page to create your first project and initialize your API keys.
2. Enter your desired Project Name and select a service for that API key.
3. After you have succesfully created your API key, you'll need it to perform and authorize API calls when using those services.

### Staging*

Since we are still in a development phase, our current domain will be [portal-testnet.maschain](https://portal-testnet.maschain.com)
