# Introduction

Welcome to the first step of diving into the world of blockchain. Here are a few steps to help you get started. <br/>

MasChain are building web3 infrastructure, that aims to lower the barrier for companies to onboard blockchain and web3.
We are building this RESTful API based Service Layer, as the integrations points between MasChain and companies. While abstracting out the complicated web3 concepts and languages.

We also separate different use cases into different Service.


## Getting Started

To kickstart integrations, you will need to go to [portal.maschain.com](https://portal.maschain.com/) to register for an enterprise account, subscribe to a **Service** that you interested to integrate and create an API key

### What you'll need

- **API Key**
- **API Secret Key**

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
