# MasWallet Introduction

**MasWallet** is a secure, blockchain-based wallet designed to serve as the primary gateway for users and developers within the **MasChain** ecosystem. It functions not only as a traditional digital wallet for managing assets, but also as an **authentication and transaction approval layer** — similar to how "Login with Google" works on many websites.

## What is MasWallet?

MasWallet allows users to:

- **Log in and authenticate** to dApps and web portals using blockchain-based identity.
- **Securely approve transactions** and interactions with smart contracts.
- **Manage assets** such as MASV tokens or custom tokens issued on MasChain.
- **Access dApps** and interact with the MasChain's blockchain securely and seamlessly.

> ✅ When a user accesses a supported dApp or portal, they will be redirected to MasWallet to **log in** and **authorize** any transaction or action — ensuring both user control and high security.

## Key Features

- 🔐 **Secure Authentication**: Similar to OAuth2 flow such as login with Google
- 🧾 **Transaction Approval**: Every blockchain interaction (token transfer, smart contract call, etc.) requires explicit approval through MasWallet.
- 🪙 **Multi-Token Support**: Supports MASV tokens and other custom tokens on MasChain.
- 📜 **Smart Contract Interaction**: Directly sign and execute smart contracts.
- 📊 **Transaction History**: View your complete activity log.
- 🧑‍💼 **Developer-Friendly**: SDKs and APIs to integrate MasWallet into your apps and platforms.

## Use Cases

MasWallet is ideal for:

- **Users**: To manage digital assets and sign into MasWallet-integrated platforms.
- **Developers**: To integrate secure login and transaction signing into web and mobile apps.
- **Enterprises**: To leverage blockchain for authentication and digital transactions.

## How It Works

1. **Login Flow**:  
   A user visits a MasWallet-integrated platform and chooses to "Login with MasWallet". They are redirected to MasWallet to sign and approve the transaction.

2. **Transaction Signing**:  
   When an action requires blockchain interaction (e.g., send tokens, create a smart contract), the platform sends the request to MasWallet. The user reviews and approves (or rejects) the transaction within MasWallet.

3. **Redirect & Confirm**:  
   Once the action is signed, the user is redirected back to the original platform with the action confirmed.

## Compatibility

MasWallet supports integration with:

- ✅ **MasChain** (Layer 1 blockchain)
- ✅ **MasExplorer** for on-chain verification
- ✅ **Custom dApps** built on MasChain

## Security

MasWallet is designed with robust security architecture:

- End-to-end encryption
- Private key never leaves the device
- Optional 2FA and biometrics
- Role-based access for institutions

> 🔐 MasWallet does **not** store your private key — everything is handled client-side.
